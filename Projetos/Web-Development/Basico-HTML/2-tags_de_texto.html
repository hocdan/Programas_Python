        <h1> This is the main heading!</h1>
        <p> 
            First paragraph: you can put any text you want here and 
            edit it to your liking. Even "edit" the words in it by letting
            them be <b> bold </b> or <i> italic </i> with the tags:
            <b>&ltb&gt</b> and <b>&lti&gt</b>. 
        </p>
        
        <h2> This is a level 2 heading! </h2>
        <p> 
            There are some nice editions (with <b>&ltsup&gt</b> and <b>&ltsub&gt</b>) like: 2<sup>3</sup> = 8 and 
            CO<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>O for example.
        </p>

        <h2> This is still a level 2 heading! </h2>
        <p> 
            Now let's see the true power of tags with these two (<b>&lthr /&gt</b> and <b>&ltbr /&gt</b>): <br />
            First, a poem: 
            <hr /> 
            Toc toc <br />
            Who is it? <br /> 
            Ligma <br />
            Ligma who? <br />
            Ligma balls!!! <br />
            <hr /> <br />
            Everybody laughs... haha!
        </p>

        <h2> Another level 2 heading! </h2>
        <p>
            Here comes another bunch of tags, they are very important to describe and pass on in
            formation to the web browsers so they can give special attention or work with it. <br />
            Here are some of them: <br />
            <br />
            1. <b>&ltstrong&gt</b>: by default shown in bold (useful to indicate strong content) <br />
            2. <b>&ltem&gt</b>: by default shown in italic (useful to indicate emphasis in some part)<br />
            <br />
            Examples: <br />
            <hr />
            <p> "I have some thoughts about your conduct: <strong>SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!</strong>."</p>
            <p> "And what if <em>we</em> could do something about <em>that problem</em>..."</p>
        </p>
